# Frontend Skills Test #11  

This project is my solution to a Frontend skills test aimed at evaluating abstraction, logic, research, recursion, and learning speed. Through this challenge, I showcased my curiosity and passion for technology by developing a functional web application.  

## What I Built  

The test had two parts with increasing difficulty, and two optional bonus tasks. Below is an explanation of how I approached and completed each part:  

### Basic Task: Pokémon Preview and Details  
For the basic task, I created a simple web application that:  
- **Home Page**: Displays the front-facing image of two Pokémon and their names (e.g., Pikachu).  
- **Details Page**: When clicking on a Pokémon, the app navigates to a details page that shows:  
  - Front, side, and back images of the Pokémon.  
  - Detailed information about its abilities and moves.  

I used a provided JSON file as the data source for this part.

### Intermediate Task: Pokémon Search with API Integration  
For the intermediate task, I implemented a Pokémon search feature that:  
1. Allows users to enter a Pokémon’s name in a search input.  
2. Fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display:  
   - The Pokémon’s front-facing image.  
   - Its name.  
   - Selected details from its abilities and moves.  

Additionally, I created a "View Moves" button that navigates to a separate page displaying the Pokémon’s moves in more detail.

### Bonus Features I Added  
- **Bonus 1: CSS and Animations**  
  - I enhanced the interface with custom CSS animations to make it more interactive and visually appealing.  
  - Modern CSS techniques were used to ensure the design is clean and responsive.  

- **Bonus 2: Framework Integration**  
  - I used **React** for the entire project, taking advantage of its component-based structure to keep the code modular and maintainable.

## Key Features  
- **Responsive Design**: The app works seamlessly across devices and browsers.  
- **Error Handling**: If the user searches for a Pokémon that doesn’t exist, an error message is displayed:  
  - Example: “Pokémon `<parameter>` not found.”  
- **Dynamic Navigation**: The app includes smooth navigation between pages, enhancing the user experience.  
- **Interactive Animations**: I incorporated animations to make the interface engaging and user-friendly.

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/lvgarces/Prueba-de-aptitudes-Frontend-Veevart.git  
   cd Prueba-de-aptitudes-Frontend-Veevart  
   ```  
2. Install the dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  
3. Start the development server:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.  

---

## Tools and Technologies I Used  
- **React**: To build the application’s structure and manage state.  
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages.  
- **CSS**: For styling and adding animations.  
- **PokeAPI**: To fetch real-time Pokémon data.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing logic and integrating the API.  

---

## Challenges I Overcame  
- **API Integration**: I learned to work with the PokeAPI, extracting and structuring the data efficiently.  
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Implementing smooth transitions between pages and handling potential errors was a rewarding challenge.  
- **State Management**: Using React’s state management tools ensured the app was responsive and functional.

## How to Use the App  
1. Visit the homepage to see two Pokémon previews.  
2. Click on any Pokémon to view its details, including abilities and moves.  
3. Use the search bar to find any Pokémon from the PokeAPI.  
4. Navigate to the moves page to see the detailed list of moves for the searched Pokémon.
